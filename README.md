[v1.7.5]
Updated _createAccount Method:
Before: The _createAccount method did not accept BuildContext as a parameter, leading to issues accessing context within it.
After: Modified the _createAccount method to include BuildContext as a parameter. This allows for displaying SnackBars or other UI elements based on the result of the Firestore query.
Added Email Existence Check:

Before: There was no check to prevent creating multiple accounts with the same email.
After: Implemented a check to query Firestore for existing documents with the same email before creating a new account. If an account with the same email already exists, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user.
Passed BuildContext to _createAccount:

Before: The context parameter was not available in the _createAccount method, which could lead to issues with UI updates.
After: Passed BuildContext from _showAccountSetupDialog when calling _createAccount, ensuring that UI elements like SnackBars can be used correctly.
Updated Navigator.pushReplacement Calls:

Before: Navigation was handled directly in the dialog actions.
After: Ensured navigation is handled appropriately after creating or setting up the account, ensuring the user is directed to the correct screen based on the account type.
General Updates
Error Handling and User Feedback:

Improved error handling and user feedback by using ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar to display relevant messages in case of sign-in or account creation failures.
Added error handling for null user scenarios and improved messaging for sign-in failures.
Updated Firestore Document Paths:

Corrected the Firestore document paths to align with the intended structure, ensuring proper user and family document updates.
